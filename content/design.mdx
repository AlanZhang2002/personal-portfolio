What makes good design?

To answer this, we should look at what design can do. From the widely respected 
Apple design choices of sleek, curved corners to the seemingly disastrous 
rebranding of X (formerly Twitter), there's been countless examples of successes and failures  
that resulted mainly from design choices. How does that work?

When you try something new or learn something new, you normally go in with some basic 
expectations, shaped by your prior experiences. Let's say, you're a software developer. 
With a lot of experience using all sorts of computer programs, you've gotten familiar with 
some design methodologies like Material Design shown by many popular apps, alongside 
fancy website and startup animations. Looking at older programs made in the Windows XP era, 
with the limited color scheme and basic rectangular buttons, it's rare to see programs today 
using older graphics. 

So when you see a program that looks exactly like it came out of the early 2000s, your 
expectations naturally drop. Regardless of whether it still has modern releases and 
the functionality works, it fails on initial impressions, and makes the whole program 
seem outdated. Although this scenario doesn't happen often, generalizing this idea to 
non-software-app situations is good to consider when creating something new.

Alternatively, when you look at something like modern Windows, with its many 
advertisement popups, hidden settings, and janky Microsoft account setup, alongside 
the huge amounts of opt-out (rather than opt-in) services, its identity is unclear, 
due to its design being convoluted. Sure, maybe an OS only needs to focus on functionality, 
with design having less of an impact, but the point still stands. Trying to do too much 
creates bad design choices as well.

I can go on and on about different designs, from a user perspective, with hardly any 
professional designing knowledge. Everything that is put into each project, 
every design, each formula, every living space, has an impact on how we view it as a whole. 
That is the essence of design.

Now, what I've found works best is keeping everything *simple* and *clean*. People's definition 
of what counts as simple or clean does vary, of course, as it is purely based on each 
person's prior experiences shaping expectations, and general definitions do shift over time 
as a result of the general user's experiences shifting over time. However, maybe something like 
Todoist works well as an example, as the UI is up to modern standards, the whole idea of the 
app is simple, and it executes extremely well on the simple task. 

In considering the design of whatever thing you are creating, there's always going to be limits 
for how simple it can get, and a tradeoff between cleanliness and functionality, among other 
considerations. But everything in life is about finding that balance, right?
